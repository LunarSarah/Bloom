# Bloom

The pitch:
	Helping to connect local gardening clubs with new members. There are lots of gardening clubs in my community that give people a space to make their own garden to grow food and connect with their environment. With Bloom you can connect with your local community gardens



## Inspiration
Growing up I saw lots of gardens in my community where people could get together and grow their own fresh
foods. I always wanted to join one so that I could grow fresh food for my family and learn more about
agriculture.  The problem was that you usually needed to know somebody who organized a community garden in
order to get your own farm plot. We wanted to make Bloom to help people connect to their local gardens and
grow roots in their community.

## What it does
Bloom helps people find local community gardens and connect with them by sharing pictures and posts. Users are
able to find local gardens using their zip code to search their area for gardens. After users find a local
garden they can read a description of the garden and use the address of the garden to see where the garden
is located. 

## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS to build the front end of our web page. The backend of our web page was built using the 
Python based web framework Flask. 

## Challenges we ran into
Coming in to Rose Hack 2022 our team had a lot of experience in making the front end of websites with CSS and HTML
but we did not know a lot about designing the backend of websites. With the advice of our mentor Ryan Yang we used
the Python based web framework Flask to develop the backend of our website. Quickly learning how to use Flask and
then integrating it into our website was difficult but we learned a lot from it and it was really exciting to learn
a new framework. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Coming into Rose Hack 2022 most of our group had not ever made a website before and did not know a lot about working
on a fast paced project. However after 24 hours we were all able to contribute to making a website. 

## What we learned
Working on the Bloom website we were all able to learn new skills to help contribute to our goal of making a website.
We had more knowledge working with front end than the back end of websites but we still needed to learn how to work
in a face paced development environment. Working on the backend was almost entirely new to us so we needed to learn 
flask quickly in order to develop the backend of our website. 

## What's next for Bloom
Connecting users to their community gardens is just the start for Bloom! In the future we hope to add more features
 to Bloom that will allow users to make posts in their community garden page and make pages for users to share
 their produce and equipment.
